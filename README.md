# FPL Planner
The Fantasy Premier League Planner will be the all in one place for you to plan out your transfers for any gameweek.
This is a long-term project with full implementation of the official premier league fantasy API as an end goal. I love watching soccer and the competetive element that the fantasy league adds is something I use to compete against my friends and family with every season.

# Technologies used:
Django,
Python,
CSS.

# Next steps:
One of the next steps I intend to take with this project is to implement the premier league API. This way you can view detailed lists all of the stats and prices for each player. I will implement the logic for transfers, budget, fixtures, fixture difficulty rating and transfers in/ transfers out.
